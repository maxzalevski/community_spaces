 GEN Ukraine is an NGO and a network of ecological communities of Ukraine that counts around 60 members. Since the beginning of the war it has run the project [Green Road of Ecovillages ](https://genukraine.com.ua/index.php/uk/gen-ukraine/our-projects/zelena-doroha-ekoposelen) : the ecological communities host refugees, renovate old houses, give shelter to abandoned animals, develop agriculture and new economical and social models.
One of the main goals of our organisation now is the development of the community spaces: common houses, common kitchens, common greenhouses.
With the war, the energy and economic crises and a big number of new people in the communities we saw the big importance of such places: they are meeting points for the whole community that let people communicate, support each other, organize education for children, share common equipment etc.
The community spaces that appeared in 2022 showed their efficiency and we are looking for support to finish building and renovation works in the common houses that are already partially done. These are 6
